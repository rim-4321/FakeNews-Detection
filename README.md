# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using supervised machine learning models and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

We use a labeled dataset from Kaggle that contains real and fake news articles. After text cleaning and vectorization (TF-IDF), multiple models are trained to accurately detect misleading news.

## âœ… Features:
- Real-world labeled dataset (`True.csv` and `Fake.csv`)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (removal of stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Training models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Visualization (optional)
- Can be extended for web deployment

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Source:
[Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

## ðŸ§  Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualizations)

## ðŸ“Œ Goal:
To build a simple yet effective fake news classifier that could assist in automated misinformation detection.
